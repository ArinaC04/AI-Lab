**1. What have you done this week?**
   - This week was my 20 year birthday and I had a short trip to see my mom in another country. Between this, work and other deadlines I could not manage to do anything code-wise.
   - Instead I read about the tier data structure and higher grade Markov chains and tried to clear up all the next theoretical topics I needed. Also read about converting the midi file to sheet music.

**2. What has been unclear or problematic?**
   - Nothing really, but there might be some problems when I will implement the ideas

**5. What next?**
   - Implement the ideas, get all done until next week

Hours spent: around 2
