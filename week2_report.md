**1. What have you done this week?**
   - set up the foundational components of the music generation project
   - created the basic Markov Chain logic on 3 notes to generate a sequence of notes based on transition probabilities. I used only 3 notes to make sure I fully get it before scaling it up.
   - implemented a simple user interface using Tkinter
   - I also configured tools for test coverage and code quality to ensure my code meets quality and testing standards

**2. How has the project progressed?**
   - The project is on track. I have a functional prototype for generating music sequences and a basic user interface that displays these sequences.

**3. What did you learn this week / today?**
   - I deepened my understanding of Markov Chains and how to apply them to music generation, particularly the importance of a well-structured transition matrix for controlling note transitions. I also learned more about using Tkinter for quick UI prototyping and the importance of configuring unit tests early in the development process. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with `coverage` for tracking test coverage and `pylint` for enforcing code quality.

**4. What has been unclear or problematic?**
   - I found some parts of setting up and using `coverage` a bit confusing, especially interpreting the coverage reports. I also realized that while the Markov Chain implementation works well for single-note transitions, expanding it to handle longer sequences (e.g., second- or third-order Markov Chains) requires more complex data structures, which I’m still exploring.

**5. What next?**
   - Next, I’ll refine the Markov Chain model to support higher-order transitions for more varied and complex music generation. I also plan to improve the user interface, allowing users to save or play back generated sequences, and to add more detailed unit tests to cover additional cases. I’ll focus on learning more about efficient data structures, such as tries, which could help manage complex transitions better.
