What have you done this week?
created the poetry project

optimized the new_note function

changed the algorithm for the program so that it takes the degree of the Markov chain as a parameter

started work on the testing and implementation document

added an end-to-end test for the code



How has the project progressed?

Now it is more complex, allows for any order of the markov chain

What did you learn this week / today?

C++ things for the peer review mainly :)

What has been unclear or problematic?

Honestly the peer review, because I do not understand java or typescript and with c++ I did competitive programming in a way, so it was quite new for me and hard as I did not understand everything. And also installing poetry turned out to be difficult.

What next?

improving the user interface, adding duration to the generation

Hours spent: around 5
