# **Weekly Progress Report**

---

### **What Have You Done This Week?**
- **Project Setup**: Created the Poetry project environment for managing dependencies.
- **Function Optimization**: Enhanced the `new_note` function for better efficiency.
- **Algorithm Improvement**: 
  - Modified the program to accept the degree of the Markov chain as a configurable parameter, improving its flexibility.
- **Documentation**: Began drafting the testing and implementation document.
- **Testing**: 
  - Added an end-to-end test to verify the entire workflow of the program.

### **How Has the Project Progressed?**
- The program now supports higher complexity by allowing user-defined Markov chain orders.
- Improved testability and functionality with the addition of end-to-end tests and algorithm flexibility.

### **What Have You Learned This Week?**
- **Peer review**:
  - C++ things for the peer review mainly :)
- **Technical Setup**:
  - Learned troubleshooting techniques while addressing issues with installing Poetry.

---

### **What Has Been Unclear or Problematic?**
- **Peer Review Challenges**:
  - Honestly the peer review, because I do not understand java or typescript and with c++ I did competitive programming in a way, so it was quite new for me and hard as I did not understand everything. And also installing poetry turned out to be difficult.
- **Poetry Installation**:
  - Encountered unexpected challenges, which took additional time to resolve.

### **Whatâ€™s Next?**
- **Interface Improvements**:
  - Work on enhancing the user interface for better usability.
- **Feature Development**:
  - Add functionality to handle note durations during melody generation.
