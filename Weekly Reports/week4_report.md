1. What have you done this week?

previously the generation took into consideration only one note, now I scaled it up to 2 and set everything up to also include duration
set up the trie data structure and all the functions it requires
reorganized the code into functions to be easier to use and understand
added all the notes initially from Vivaldi's Spring, but then completed the trie with more compositions

2. How has the project progressed?

Now it is more complex, generating quite nice music sequences, but then, how can they not be nice when it is based on such classical masterpieces :) Also now the code is better structured
3. What did you learn this week / today?

Creating the trie data structure with all its necessary functions was very interesting, it allows for an easy step-up in complexity
4. What has been unclear or problematic?

As fun as the trie set-up was, it was also difficult at times, especially because I have had one idea and after developing the code I realized that maybe the first idea should be changed. This happened with the storage of a node's children.
5. What next?

third-order Markov chain and including duration. Adding some customization options to the interface. I did not manage this week to develop it, as I focused on the main program.

Hours spent: around 8
