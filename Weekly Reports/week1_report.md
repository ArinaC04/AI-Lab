This week I have researched the topic "Markov chains" and music generation. This interests me, because I find the prediction/generating based on data using AI impressive, and it still marvels me how it is solely based on mathematics. I have written code for many predictive tasks and even digit recognition, but always wondered how GenAI works. This pushed me to choose the theme of music generation. Next I would like to write down an outline of the program. I will code in python.
